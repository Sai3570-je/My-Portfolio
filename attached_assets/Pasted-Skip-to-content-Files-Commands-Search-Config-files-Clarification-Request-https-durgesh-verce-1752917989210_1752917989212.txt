I'll help you replicate this portfolio website. Let me first examine the original website to understand its structure and design, then create a plan for replicating it.


Visited https://durgesh.vercel.app/
Based on the website I've examined and the screenshots you've provided, I can see this is a developer portfolio with a distinctive terminal/code editor aesthetic. The website features a dark theme with green/blue accent colors, a sidebar navigation, and multiple sections including Home, About, Experience, Projects, Contact, and Blog.

I can absolutely replicate this portfolio for you! The design has a sleek, developer-focused interface that resembles a code editor with:

Dark theme with syntax highlighting colors
Sidebar navigation with file-tree style structure
Terminal-like interface with command prompts
Interactive elements like hover effects and typing animations
Multiple pages for different sections

You're absolutely right! Let me examine the original website more carefully and look at your screenshots again to understand the exact design and functionality.

Now I can see the exact structure! Looking at your screenshots and the website content, I can see this is specifically designed like a VS Code editor interface with:

Left sidebar that looks exactly like VS Code's file explorer
Line numbers on the left side of the content
Code syntax highlighting and structure
Breadcrumb navigation at the top
VS Code-style tabs and layout
Let me create the correct plan now:

Now I can see it clearly! You're absolutely right - I was missing the key details. Looking at your full browser screenshots, I can see this is designed to look like a desktop application window (like VS Code) that's running in a browser. The interface has:

Window controls (minimize, maximize, close buttons) in the top-right
App title bar with "D." logo and "Home" text
Left sidebar with navigation items and specific icons
Main content area without line numbers (I was wrong about that)
Terminal-style interface on the homepage with the "whois" command
Desktop app aesthetic - it looks like a native application, not a website
Let me create the correct plan:

Background Color: #0d1117 for navbar and sidebar
Main area: Slightly lighter than #0d1117
Layout: Flexbox with center alignment
Height: 324px for main content area
Width: 698.2px for content

Perfect! Now I can see the exact details from the developer tools. I can see:

Main background color: Much darker than what I mentioned - it's almost black (bg-bgBlack)
Hover functionality: The "Download CV" and "My Blog Site" buttons should only appear when hovering over "Hover to get the code" text
Button styling: They appear in a thin black container/tooltip when hovered
CSS classes: I can see the exact classes like bg-bgBlack, shadow, rounded-full, etc.

Sidebar and top bar color: Both should be the same darker color like #0a0d12 (much darker than what I had)
Breadcrumb navigation: When clicking on About, it should show Home\About in the breadcrumb, and similarly for other pages

Perfect! Now I can see the exact HTML structure and CSS classes from the developer tools. I can see:

Layout structure: fixed top-[76px], flex, items-center, justify-center
Background classes: bg-bgBlackSec for containers
Text styling: text-4xl, text-tBlue for "Web Developer", text-tWhiteSec for other text
Input element: placeholder="whois" with specific styling classes
SVG icon: With specific path and styling
Hover element: absolute hidden class for the tooltip that appears on hover
Container classes: bg-black, shadow-lg, group-hover:inline for the hover functionality
This gives me the exact class structure and styling approach used. The plan is now complete and accurate!

Yes, I can now replicate this exactly with all the precise CSS classes, color schemes (#0a0d12 for sidebar/topbar), breadcrumb navigation (Home\About), hover functionality, and the exact layout structure you've shown me.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this portfolio with all these exact specifications? I have all the details I need:

Exact color codes and CSS classes
Proper hover functionality for the Download CV and Blog Site buttons
Breadcrumb navigation system
Desktop window interface
All the layout and styling details from your developer tools screenshots
Once you approve the plan, I can start building this pixel-perfect replica for you!

hey where is the side bar

trainwithjk26
You're absolutely right! I can see from the HTML structure that there's a sidebar with tablet:pl-[225px] padding, which means there's a 225px wide sidebar on the left. Let me check the sidebar structure from the original website:


Visited https://durgesh.vercel.app/
I need to get the sidebar structure. From your screenshots, I can see the sidebar has:

Home (with home icon)
About (with document icon)
Experience (with star icon)
Projects (with folder icon)
Contact (with phone icon)
Blog (with blog icon)
Let me update the plan to include the complete sidebar structure:

Sidebar styling: bg-bgBlackSec, border-[1px] border-black/30
Navigation items: Each with flex w-[200px] items-center gap-2 py-3 pl-4
Active state: bg-bgBlack for current page
